# EcoGrow

EcoGrow, a start-up based in Cape Town, South Africa, aims to revolutionize food purchasing by directly connecting consumers with local farmers through a digital marketplace. This platform addresses the challenges faced by farmers who rely on intermediaries that reduce their profit margins and limit their market reach, while also catering to consumers who seek fresh, locally sourced produce but struggle to find it. By facilitating direct transactions, EcoGrow supports healthier eating habits, bolsters local economies, and reduces carbon emissions from long-distance food transportation, creating a mutually beneficial solution for both farmers and consumers.
